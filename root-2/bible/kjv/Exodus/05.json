  "1": "And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.",
  "2": "And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.",
  "3": "And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert...",
  "4": "And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.",
  "5": "And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.",
  "6": "And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,",
  "7": "Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.",
  "8": "And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof...",
  "9": "Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.",
  "10": "And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying...",
  "11": "Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.",
  "12": "So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.",
  "13": "And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.",

  "17": "But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.",
  "18": "Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.",
  "19": "And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case...",
  "20": "And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:",
  "21": "And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred...",
  "22": "And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people?...",
  "23": "For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all."
